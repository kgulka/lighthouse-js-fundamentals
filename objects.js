//## OBJECTS (Exercise 15 of 20)  
   
  //Objects are lists of values similar to arrays, except values are  
  //identified by keys instead of integers.  
   
  //Here is an example:  
   
     const foodPreferences = {  
       pizza: 'yum',  
       salad: 'gross'  
     }  
   
 //## The challenge:  
   
  //Create a file named objects.js.  
   
  //In that file, define a variable named pizza like this:  
   
     const pizza = {  
       toppings: ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni'],  
       crust: 'deep dish',  
       serves: 2  
     }  
   console.log(pizza);
  //Use console.log() to print the pizza object to the terminal.  
   
  //Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
   
 //    javascripting verify objects.js
